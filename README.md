## About me:
- Pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at MSU Denver (Expected Dec 2026)
- Learning Assistant helping students in Java, OOP, data structures, and algorithms
- Passionate about unit testing, APIs, cloud computing, automation, and open source
- Building fullstack web apps, Java simulators, interactive sites, and scrapers, always learning as I go
- Raspberry Pi is my excuse for turning normal things into questionable tech experiments
